# Redesign of the Bloomberg story on "How Americans Die"

The [original story](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/dataview/how-americans-die/) is a beautiful example of storytelling through visualizations. They use a lot of animations to transition from one visualization to the next.

This project intends to address some of the problems found in the transitions and to test what works best with users.

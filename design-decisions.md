# Design decisions

## Goal

This document outlines the reasoning process behind the design decisions of the experimental setup.

## Log

### Dimensions

The dimensions of the visualizations should be fixed. No participant will therefore see more or less details than another based on differing browser window sizes.

At the beginning of the experiment, the browser window dimensions are checked. Participants with window sizes that are not large enough to show enough content are excluded from the experiment.

As per January 2019, at least 83% of desktop website visitors worldwide have screen resolutions wider then 1280px and higher than 720px. This will therefore be the target resolution of the experiment. [^Statcounter]

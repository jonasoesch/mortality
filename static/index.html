                <p>AIDS, which at its peak, killed more than 40,000 Americans a year (more than 30,000 of whom were&nbsp;25&nbsp;to&nbsp;44&nbsp;years&nbsp;old).</p>
                <p>(Slowing infection rates and better treatment eventually allowed many of those with the virus  to survive&nbsp;into&nbsp;their&nbsp;50s&nbsp;and&nbsp;60s)</p>
                <p>For a few years, <strong style="background-color: rgb(241, 49, 71); color: white; padding: 3px">AIDS</strong> was the single biggest killer of Americans who should otherwise have been in the prime of their&nbsp;lives.</p>

                <p>The mortality rate fell by about 17 percent from 1968 through 2010, years for which we have detailed data.</p>
                <p>Almost all of this improvement can be attributed to improved survival prospects for <strong style="background-color: rgb(27, 122, 199); color: white; padding: 3px">men</strong></p>

                <p>If you divide the population into separate age cohorts, you can see that  improvements in life expectancy have been broad-based and ongoing.</p>
                <p>Looking at mortality for each age cohort since 1968, we see that Americans <strong style="background-color: rgb(117, 212, 156); color: white; padding: 3px"> under 25</strong> have made the most progress.</p>
                <p>But one line in this chart looks unusual! Look at the mortality rate for people <strong style="background-color: rgb(60, 190, 203); color: white; padding: 3px">aged&nbsp;25-44</strong>.</p>

                <p>AIDS, which at its peak, killed more than 40,000 Americans a year (more than 30,000 of whom were&nbsp;25&nbsp;to&nbsp;44&nbsp;years&nbsp;old).</p>
                <p>(Slowing infection rates and better treatment eventually allowed many of those with the virus  to survive&nbsp;into&nbsp;their&nbsp;50s&nbsp;and&nbsp;60s)</p>
                <p>For a few years, <strong style="background-color: rgb(241, 49, 71); color: white; padding: 3px">AIDS</strong> was the single biggest killer of Americans who should otherwise have been in the prime of their&nbsp;lives.</p>
